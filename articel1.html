        <h3> Recently, on the 24th of August, the volcano Vesuvius erupted and destroyed Pompeii completely. Caecilia, a widow and single mother of two children Cyrus and Cassius got traumatized by the natural disaster. She lost her poor children, but that is not the only thing she lost due to the eruption, she also lost her house and everything.  </h3>
        <hr/>
        
        <h3>Can you tell us what happened from your perspective? </h3>
        <T2>It all started when I saw an enormous blackish cloud coming out of the well-known mountain, Vesuvius. It just looked like an umbrella pine, but it was full of dirt and ashes. I was at the store and let Cyrus and Cassius stay home alone, since they always ran around and distracted me. When I arrived at the cash out, I heard all kinds of screams. I turned around to see people running around and shouting/screaming. It was raining, but it was not raining normally. Thick pieces of pumice and charred stones fell out of the sky. I could not help but run to my children since they were home alone. I have already lost my husband. I could not lose my two children. I was running and looking around, seeing the sea was shallow and how the ships were all destroyed and locked in by debris from the mountain.</T2>
        <h3>What happened when you arrived home? </h3>
        <t2>When I arrived home, I was shocked, to find my two children not present. The door was widened and there was an empty house. I started screaming too, because I felt defeated, why was this all happening. I did not have any choice but to just flee.  </t2>
        <h3>What happened to the other family members? </h3>
        <t2>I almost arrived at my lovely mother's house, until I felt an unexpected shake. Everything around me was shaking. It was an earthquake, but it has never been so disastrous. All the people came outside, just like a mass of worms, but suddenly I could see my two children in between them. It felt as if a sunray was shining on them. I was about to run to them until I heard everyone gasp.  </t2>
        <h3>How did Mount Vesuvius look like? </h3>
        <T2>The Mount Vesuvius, there was a weird substance coming out of the mount; the substance looked more like fire. There also came an enormous fearful black cloud, which was followed by the fire-looking substance. It all spread over the earth like a flood. Pompeii looked like a living real hell. Everyone started fleeing, including me, because the end of Pompeii was in sight. I could not help but just pray to God that my children are safe and okay. By the minute it got hotter and hotter. It got hot to the point that a cup of water dried up immediately. Afterwards, the black fire-looking substance thinned and dispersed just like a cloud. Then daylight came again, but it was yellow, as if I was seeing an eclipse going on, or when there is a heatwave going on in a dessert. But when I looked at Pompeii, it was all buried deep in ashes like snowdrifts. I do not have hope anymore, I know that my children are not alive anymore. </T2>
        <h3>How did it affect your health? </h3>
        <T2>The main thing was that the smell was awful, like burning pig meat and strong burning petrol. Everyone around me was coughing, including me. I assume that there came toxic substances out of Mount Vesuvius. A lot of people around me were also suffocating. I will never forget the image, but what I will not forget anymore is the loss of my two children and the missing of my lovely mother. This natural disaster did not only destroy my physical health but also my mental health. </T2>
