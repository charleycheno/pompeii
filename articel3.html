        <h3>Hello Servius,</h3>
        <t2>Hello</t2>
        <h3>How was your life before the eruption?</h3>
        <t2>It was awesome, me and my girlfriend were about to get married. But while  the marriage was happening the volcano erupted and we looked outside, and there was  a lot lava and it was very hot. I ran away but my girlfriend didn’t want to come with me. She saw her mother in the lava and she was afraid and wanted to rescue her. But then, out of nowhere, the lava came into the house and I escaped but my girlfriend sadly died. It started as the best day of my life and ended as the worst. </t2>
        <h3>But how is your life right now?</h3>
        <t2>I now live on the other side of the volcano where the lava has created fertile ground. Where I live on a farm . I  grow some wheat and sell it to the local village for low prices so i dont earn much. I once was a rich man but all my wealth is gone</t2>
        <h3>Do you think that the volcano with erupt again this hard?</h3>
        <t2>Maybe in the future but this was definitely one of the biggest eruptions on earth. Everyone died and an entire city got buried under the ground .The only plus side is that the ground is now very fertile and I can still make some money, but not the amount I made before though. </t2>
        <h3>But what are you going to do now?</h3>
        <t2>I want to get rich again. I  was a farmer and made some money with it, after that I invested with my spare money and got a lot of profit and i am trying to do that again. If I am repaired from everything that happened I also want to find a new girlfriend. My entire family died so they cant decide who I am going to marry with anymore. But the when she has a family they are probably not going to accept me if I am not rich, so I am going to get rich and then search for a wife and I hope I once have a family with who I can share this story with</t2>
        <h3>Do you have lung problems from the smoke?</h3>
        <t2>My lungs kind of hurt and it still smells like smoke and its still hot around here. You literally can’t enter the place where Pompeii was because there is to much smoke it is a  health hazard</t2>
        <h3>Well Servius, have a great day and I hope you will achieve your dreams!</h3>
        <t2>Thank you, and goodbye!</t2>
