        <h3>Today we interviewed Servius Domanus. He is one of the only people that survived the terrible eruption of the Mount Vesuvius. We asked him what happened, what he is doing now and what his life goals are now.</h3>
        <hr/>
        <h3>Hello Servius,</h3>
        <t2>Hello</t2>
        <h3>How was your life before the eruption?</h3>
        <t2>It was awesome, me and my girlfriend were about to get married. But while the marriage was happening the volcano erupted and when we looked outside, there was a lot lava and it was very hot and muggy. I ran away but my girlfriend didn’t want to come with me. She saw her mother in the lava and she was afraid and wanted to rescue her. But then, out of nowhere, the lava came into the house and I escaped, but my girlfriend and all the other guests sadly died. It started as the best day of my life and ended as the worst.</t2>
        <h3>But how is your life right now?</h3>
        <t2>I now live on the other side of the volcano where the lava has created fertile ground. I grow some wheat and sell it to the local village for low prices, so i dont earn much money. I once was a rich man but all my wealth is gone.</t2>
        <h3>Do you think that the volcano with erupt again this hard?</h3>
        <t2>Maybe in the future but this was definitely one of the biggest volcano eruptions on earth. Everyone died and an entire city got buried under the ground .The only positive side is that the ground is now very fertile and I can still make some money, but not the amount I made before the eruption.</t2>
        <h3>But what are you going to do now?</h3>
        <t2>I want to get rich again. I was a farmer and I earned some money, after that I invested with my spare money and got a lot of profit and I am trying to do that again. If I have healed  from everything that has happened I  want to find a new wive. My entire family died so they cant decide who I am going to marry with. But  when she has a family they are probably not going to accept me if I am not wealthy, so I am going to get rich and then search for a wife and I hope I can create a family with who I can share this story with.</t2>
        <h3>Do you have lung problems from the smoke?</h3>
        <t2>My lungs hurt and it still smells like smoke around here. You literally can’t enter the place where Pompeii was because there is to much smoke and ashes. It is a health hazard to even come near Pompeii.</t2>
        <h3>Well Servius, have a great day and I hope you will achieve your dreams!</h3>
        <t2>Thank you, and goodbye!</t2>
