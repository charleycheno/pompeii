        <h3><b>On 24th August a terrible eruption of the volcano Vesuvius completely buried Pompeii under ashes and debris today weâ€™re interviewing a survivor of the eruption to know what happened.</b></h3>
        <hr/>
       
        <h3>Hello, your Julius Romanus right could you tell us how you survived that faithful night.</h3> 
        <t2>Yes I am Julius Romanus. I am a fisherman who lived in Pompeii at the time of the accident. Me and my nephew decided to go on a 2-day fishing trip on the 23rd of august we did not have much luck and doubted if we should return earlier. I am glad we did not because when we went back and got close to Pompeii the sky turned black and we saw a giant gas cloud full of stones and ash we wanted to see what happened and got a little closer. We could see giant avalanches move down from the mountain into Pompeii. We thought no this can't be true Vesuvius erupted.  we did not think we could help anyone and quickly turned back to the open sea in an attempt to get away from the danger since the air did not seem healthy and my nephew was coughing. We eventually escaped the dark black cloud and were relieved </t2>
        <h3>What was your live like before the eruption? </h3>
        <t2>Me and my family lived in Pompeii at the harbour in a small but lovely house we lived in the house with my nephew family and my wife 's nephew family. Me my nephew and my wife's nephew were all fishermen while the wives sold and prepared the fish in the shop. we weren't that rich, but we were still fine, and we had enough money to let our kids go to school and by other vegetables because the seas around Pompeii were rich in SeaLife so there was always enough to catch and come around. My oldest was 16 and sometimes helped with fishing and my youngest was 3. we had 3 girls and 2 boys who were all lovely children whom I miss very much nowadays. </t2>
        <h3>What's your life like nowadays? </h3>
        <t2>Me and my nephew sailed to Naples because we had family from my wife who lived there and when we sailed into the harbour and docked our boat we saw them running at us because they lived at the harbour and recognised our boat they asked us if we were fine and they said that my wife and 2 of my kids had walked to Naples as survivors of the explosion and they thought that we were dead like all the others. Well, we were not so my wife's family offered a place in their house to sleep and eat until we had enough money to get our own house. Sadly, the whole family of my nephew died and he grieved about that for two months so I had to do the fishing alone. But now that he is back, we are getting our old numbers of fish per day back and we almost have enough to buy a house for ourselves. </t2>
        <h3>Thank you Julius Romanus I hope life continues normal from here and have a great day </h3>
        <t2>Thanks, you are too goodbye and may Jupiter be with you. I hope I will see you again. </t2>
